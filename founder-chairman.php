<p>Nehru Group of Institutions was established in 1968 in Kuniamuthur, Coimbatore, TamilNadu as a centre of educational excellence to nurture, guide and ignite the spirit of the young minds in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.This was fifty years ago when education opportunities were limited and information centres were not equipped with adequate resources.NGI was founded on this philosophy to serve students, especially from economically backward backgrounds looking out for continuing education pathways with an academic and vocational direction.</p>
<p>Late P. K. Das, our founder-chairman gave up his lucrative job in the Air Force and chose to pursue his dream of building a centre of educational excellence. With a vision to establish Nehru Group of Institutions, he embarked on the mission, encountering first-hand experience of the difficulties and the challenges that sprung up unawares. His demise in 2009, saw the mantle of responsibility fall on the very able shoulders of his sons, Managing Trustee, Adv. Dr. P. Krishna Das and CEO & Secretary, Dr. P. Krishna Kumar, who weathered the fiercest of storms and challenges, to build up the walls and to emerge as contenders in the now changing world of education. They have stood fast in their faith of seeing their fatherâ€™s vision fulfilled and get the institution a University status, without compromising on the ethics and principles,</p>
<p>We have, in the past 50 years, successfully nurtured, groomed and placed approximately 1,00,000 plus students in the best of corporate, here and abroad. Our service is complete. We have branches ranging from architecture to technology across Tamil Nadu and Kerala, our corporate office in Coimbatore, all delivering objective advice and maintaining a professional level of service to students and parents.</p>
<p>NGI has risen above every storm and challenge and has stood tall even while going through the fiery furnace of tests. 2018 marks 50 years of this unstoppable VICTORY.</p>
