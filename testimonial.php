                    this college last year. I am doing post-graduation in business administration from Nehru 
                    School of Management.</p>
                    <p>Our college has a good infrastructure with qualified and experienced faculties. During 
                    pandemic like all other students I also have faced difficulty in adjusting with the new learning
                    method. But all the teachers are very motivating and supportive in nature. All the portions are
                    covered on time. Many webinars are conducted by the college which is very informative.</p>
                    <p>I am happy to hear that our many of the seniors got placed in reputed companies. I am glad to
                    be part of the college.</p>

                    <p>Classes started on an online platform due to the pandemic in the
                    academic year 2020-2021. We experienced the online mode for the first time and it was very
                    difficult for a student like me to interact with students and staff without seeing them, but
                    teachers make us feel comfortable to interact with each other through various sessions and
                    activities. They succeeded to make a good relationship between the students even in the
                    pandemic situation. The faculty members in our college are extremely excellent. They were
                    always available to clear all the doubts and concepts. We only got 2 weeks to enjoy our
                    college life in the first semester those days were amazing and useful. Our campus provides a
                    positive vibe and an eco-friendly atmosphere. The infrastructure is excellent and
                    professionally arranged.</p>

                    <p>One of the best things about college life is that a new experience every day. But 
                    as classes are of online I miss the college life truly. Even though the classes are 
                    in online the faculties provide correct guidelines. They explain each and every 
                    topic clearly. Apart from providing knowledge, teachers are friendly to students. 
                    They also provide internships and webinars to students. This is really helpful for 
                    us. Even the classes are in online, the faculties also keep in touch with the 
                    students.
                    </p>
                    <p>The webinars provided by the college is truly helpful and increases our skills 
                    and knowledge. I think Nehru group will help to pursue my goals and help me 
                    to chase my dreams.</p>

                    <p>I feel prerogative to be a part of Nehru school of management. 
                    Whenever I had a glimpse about my journey in Nehru school of 
                    management, I wonder how beautiful and heart touching it is. My 
                    friends, teachers, class room, even now I can feel that mumble. I would 
                    like to include my academic experience, which gave me with handful of 
                    knowledge. We had a respectful and friendly relationship with our 
                    teachers, they support us, and they make sure that we are capable 
                    enough to enter to corporate world. We had yoga session, from which 
                    we get a chance to boast up ourselves for that we were provided with a 
                    calm atmosphere. It was indeed a stress reliving session. And we had 
                    Friday activities; I would say that it was funny meaning and fascinating. 
                    the importance thing that I don't want to miss here is our karma national 
                    level management fest, that is voluntarily taken by the students 
                    themselves, which help in building our management skill.i know those 
                    days could not be brought back, but I can say that I choose the best 
                    campus for my pg and I am confident that I can do my best with the 
                    importance lesson that I gained from Nehru school of management.</p>

                    Center” I have a somewhat clear knowledge about the college. After completing 
                    my UG I decided to go for postgraduation by doing MBA. And I chose NSM 
                    because it provides many opportunities and activities for getting more practical 
                    knowledge of the course. But faith due to the pandemic we didn’t get the 
                    campus experiences, but that’s OK we still have hope that everything will come 
                    back normal soon.</p>
                    <p>In spite we have online classes. The faculties put their whole efforts to make the 
                    class interactive. The activities like making up business plan is really interesting 
                    that make knowledge about business. The webinars provided by college is very 
                    informative, that would help in my career to face the future. The activities and 
                    programs you providing for us is very interesting and really appreciating one. 
                    You give a lot of opportunities to improve our skills and abilities. I thank Nehru 
                    school of management for gave me this wonderful opportunity to do my
